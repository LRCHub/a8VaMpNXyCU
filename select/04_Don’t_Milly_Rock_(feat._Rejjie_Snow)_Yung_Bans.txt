Hold up
Drop top, skrrt skrrt
But that girl needs a visa
First class, I splurge
All the way from Argentina
Milly Rock, hide ya safe
The pots, the rocks, and all the Rafs
Alexander, he wack
Your my journey, keys and my half
My Beemer race and go fast
Tay-K, my life is on blast
Hold up, switch the payment
Dat boy's about to be famous
Those songs I wrote in my basement
No Milly Rock and no paper

I don't milly rock, huh, I just get the guap, ayy
Ridin' around with no top, ayy,
Fell in love, hoe, she a thot, ayy, yeah, huh, ayy yeah
Fell in love, hoe, she a thot (thot)
I don't milly rock (thot), I just get the guap
I don't milly rock, ayy, I just get the guap, huh
Ridin' around with no top, ayy,
Fell in love, hoe, she a thot, ayy, yeah, yeah, ayy yeah
Them niggas mad 'cause we hot (hot)
Look at my diamonds, they pop (pop)
We never run outta stock (yeah)
