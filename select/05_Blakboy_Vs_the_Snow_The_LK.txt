If he had to go left or right or wrong
He'd rather kill the referee
Blakboys the type, the food is right
When snow falls in Calgary

Gosh for a snuff home video
Though it wasn't very well hung
They stuffed him goodnight, hey that's alright
I'll just breath with the other lung

Hey mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror when I'm growing tall
I'd rather be the pin than the ball
Rather cool than wet my panties on rock'n'roll

Why don't we bring a stereo
And disappear in jamboree
We'll drive on in the sound to the flowers on the ground
When snow falls in Calgary
