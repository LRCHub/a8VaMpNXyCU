I just wanna be the best rapper here
Momma
Climb that pedestal, who the coolest here?
Momma
Walking Jordan Nike Air pump kick
Momma
Freedom for them black kids dying here
Momma
Please, will you save me from them record labels?
Momma
Water in my chalice, Holy Trinity
Momma
I just wanna die a pretty bitch and love
Momma
All my lil' homies getting locked up
Momma
Why the fuck's the system made to stop us here?
Momma
Comparisons to Biggie, fuck your ignorance
Momma
Chemical atomic bombs dropping quick
Africa was never so black and now my dick is big
Doggystyle and [?] blow, rhythm in my fucking bones
Daddies that were never here, granny raised the strongest one
If you look to God, then why the fuck you niggas lying for?
Hopping in that living room, you're lazy and you fucking suck, uh
I just won a Grammy for the second time
Momma
If I die tonight, just know my sins were free
Momma
All my money gone, I'm not a sober soul
Momma
Showing off her tits up on that Instagram
Momma
Remember when I lied about that shooting here
Momma
But now I'm shooting back and seeing star moons
Momma
All I gotta do is press record here
Momma
Shows flippin' hoes, oh, what a lovely day
Momma
I just might and go and sniff a line here
Momma
Depression got the best of me, I'm falling in
Momma
It's time to be the man so when my screams cry
Momma
One legged vets from Vietnam, silencer, I grip my hand
And aim that beam as heaven's gates opened up, I know my plan
Don't ever talk about my momma
Skinny Leg's my nickname, kill you and my papa
Black pancakes on this rainy day
Momma
Leader of the new school, my flow's real
Momma
Only try to test it in this new veil
Momma
All my favourite rappers died right here
Momma
Lucifer is coming, hold your fucking tongue
Momma
Never will I kiss the ground and look away
Momma
Beautiful, my allegations honest, yeah
Momma
Murder was my reputation, don't fear
Momma
